### 1.1 笔记原则

==看得懂、简单、快==

- 听到信息后的第一反应，就是最佳笔记

- 不能影响理解（因记废听）

- 尽量多记实词，名词和形容词

- 动词经常可以通过名词推出来，也可以用符号代替

- 逻辑词后的信息尽量记

#### 逻辑词敏感

因果（解释逗哏的观点

Becaues/since/that's why/ the reason/so

转折（引出真正的重点）

But/however/on the other hand

并列

Also/plus/ furthermore/too

### 1.2 准备时间利用

- 不要在脑海里答题
  - 答不完
  - 脑海里顺不一定说的顺
- 把笔记过一遍，理顺思路
  - 添加词：名词、形容词、动词、逻辑词
  - 删掉看不懂的词
  - 删掉重复细节
  - 能做多少做多少
  - 按照原文思路复述，不要调整顺序
