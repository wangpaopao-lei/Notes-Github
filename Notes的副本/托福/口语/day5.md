> Well, personally, I would choose a humorous teacher. Firstly, a humorous teacher helps create a lively atmosphere. In such an environment, I feel more relaxed and comfortable. This comfort level encourages me to express my ideas freely and actively participate in class discussions, which makes me learn better. Secondly, a humorous teacher makes it easier for students to approach and communicate with him or her. Their approachable demeanor reduces the distance between the student and teacher. In contrast, if I were studying under a very serious teacher, I might hesitate or even be afraid to ask questions.
