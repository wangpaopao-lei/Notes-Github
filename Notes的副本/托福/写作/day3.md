题目中的 proposal ， 是政府为了减少汽车的二氧化碳排放。

简而言之就是论点要对上题目的目的，不要跑题



如果总观点是反对，如何写分论点？

1. 这个选项不能达到目标 -> 很难去说清楚不能达到目标这件事
2. 虽然能达成目标，但是造成更大问题、严重后果



题目越来越长，题目限定越来越多

最好就在限定中去写

> I totally agree with Abdrew's view that it is benificial for school to organize outdoor classes for student once a month. It is because such a teaching approach enhances students' hands-on experience and fosters a sence of responsibility towards the environment.
>
> By witnessing environmental issues like pollution and degredation firsthand, students gain a deeper understanding of the severity of these probelms, which can be never learned in classroom.  Consider, for instance, the visible difference between a polluted waterway and a clean stream. In a classroom setting, students might see images or videos of polluted rivers, but seeing it in person — observing the color of the water, the lack of aquatic life, or perhaps even the smell — provides a visceral experience that is hard to forget.
